If you have any issues with the Proteus project, you can find the libraries here: https://electronics-go.com/protues-libraries/
Make sure to run Proteus in administrator mode and that all the HEX files can be found.

One small note, I tried finding an MQ2 sensor with an analog output but couldn't. 
Tried replacing that with a sine generator in Proteus, the returned concentration
seemed to only climb up, so the concentration function must be tested more once 
we get the sensor IRL.
